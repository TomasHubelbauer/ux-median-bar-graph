    <p>This is a median bar graph.</p>
    <div id="graphDiv"></div>
    <p>
      It accepts an array of numbers, calculates its median, adjusts it using a
      factor of the user's choice and uses the resulting threshold as its upper
      limit.
    </p>
    <div>
      <label for="factorInput">Factor:</label>
      <input id="factorInput" type="number" value="1.5" step=".1" min="0" max="10" />
      <br />
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Values:</legend>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Value</th>
              <th>State</th>
              <th>
                <button id="addValueButton">+</button>
              </th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody id="valuesTbody"></tbody>
        </table>
      </fieldset>
    </div>
    <p>
      Values that do not reach the threshold are rendered with height relative
      to them compared to the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Values that do reach or surpass the threshold are rendered as tall as the
      graph itself and have a label sit atop them which indicates the factor by
      which they surpass the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea is that by choosing the median, the bars which do not reach it
      provide superior visual indication of their relative magnitudes and those
      do or surpass it do not distort the graph to the point where its visually
      indicative value is lost. The labels with their factors serve as a
      secondary indicator enabling further inspection of the magnitudes of all
      the values.
